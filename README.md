# Lexical Class Prediction in American Sign Language

## Overview

This project undergoes the full data science and machine learning pipeline, from
data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing, to model selection with hyperparameter
tuning and finally to model evaluation and interpretability.

The prediction task done in this project is to identify the lexical class (such as
noun, verb, adjective, etc.) of various signs in American Sign Language (ASL). It is
done on ASL-LEX, a dataset of over 2000 American Sign Language signs.
